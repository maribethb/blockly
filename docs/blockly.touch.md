## Touch namespace

## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [checkTouchIdentifier(e)](./blockly.touch.checktouchidentifier.md) | Check whether the touch identifier on the event matches the current saved identifier. If there is no identifier, that means it's a mouse event and we'll use the identifier "mouse". This means we won't deal well with multiple mice being used at the same time. That seems okay. If the current identifier was unset, save the identifier from the event. This starts a drag/gesture, during which touch events with other identifiers will be silently ignored. |
|  [clearTouchIdentifier()](./blockly.touch.cleartouchidentifier.md) | Clear the touch identifier that tracks which touch stream to pay attention to. This ends the current drag/gesture and allows other pointers to be captured. |
|  [getTouchIdentifierFromEvent(e)](./blockly.touch.gettouchidentifierfromevent.md) | Get the touch identifier from the given event. If it was a mouse event, the identifier is the string 'mouse'. |
|  [isMouseOrTouchEvent(e)](./blockly.touch.ismouseortouchevent.md) | Check whether a given event is a mouse, touch, or pointer event. |
|  [isTouchEvent(e)](./blockly.touch.istouchevent.md) | Check whether a given event is a touch event or a pointer event. |
|  [setClientFromTouch(e)](./blockly.touch.setclientfromtouch.md) | Set an event's clientX and clientY from its first changed touch. Use this to make a touch event work in a mouse event handler. |
|  [shouldHandleEvent(e)](./blockly.touch.shouldhandleevent.md) | Decide whether Blockly should handle or ignore this event. Mouse and touch events require special checks because we only want to deal with one touch stream at a time. All other events should always be handled. |
|  [splitEventByTouches(e)](./blockly.touch.spliteventbytouches.md) | Split an event into an array of events, one per changed touch or mouse point. |

## Variables

|  Variable | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [TOUCH\_ENABLED](./blockly.touch.touch_enabled.md) | Whether touch is enabled in the browser. Copied from Closure's goog.events.BrowserFeature.TOUCH\_ENABLED |
|  [TOUCH\_MAP](./blockly.touch.touch_map.md) | The TOUCH\_MAP lookup dictionary specifies additional touch events to fire, in conjunction with mouse events. |
