## zelos.TopRow class

An object containing information about what elements are in the top row of a block as well as sizing information for the top row. Elements in a top row can consist of corners, hats, spacers, and previous connections. After this constructor is called, the row will contain all non-spacer elements it needs.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class TopRow extends BaseTopRow 
```
<b>Extends:</b> BaseTopRow

## Remarks

The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `TopRow` class.
