## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [closest(maxLimit, dxy)](./blockly.renderedconnection.closest.md) |  | Find the closest compatible connection to this connection. All parameters are in workspace units. |
|  [connect\_(childConnection)](./blockly.renderedconnection.connect_.md) |  | Connect two connections together. This is the connection on the superior block. Rerender blocks as needed. |
|  [disconnectInternal\_(parentBlock, childBlock)](./blockly.renderedconnection.disconnectinternal_.md) |  | Disconnect two blocks that are connected by this connection. |
|  [distanceFrom(otherConnection)](./blockly.renderedconnection.distancefrom.md) |  | Returns the distance between this connection and another connection in workspace units. |
|  [getSourceBlock()](./blockly.renderedconnection.getsourceblock.md) |  | Get the source block for this connection. |
|  [highlight()](./blockly.renderedconnection.highlight.md) |  | Add highlighting around this connection. |
|  [moveBy(dx, dy)](./blockly.renderedconnection.moveby.md) |  | Change the connection's coordinates. |
|  [moveTo(x, y)](./blockly.renderedconnection.moveto.md) |  | Change the connection's coordinates. |
|  [moveToOffset(blockTL)](./blockly.renderedconnection.movetooffset.md) |  | Move this connection to the location given by its offset within the block and the location of the block's top left corner. |
|  [onCheckChanged\_()](./blockly.renderedconnection.oncheckchanged_.md) |  | Function to be called when this connection's compatible types have changed. |
|  [respawnShadow\_()](./blockly.renderedconnection.respawnshadow_.md) |  | Respawn the shadow block if there was one connected to the this connection. Render/rerender blocks as needed. |
|  [setOffsetInBlock(x, y)](./blockly.renderedconnection.setoffsetinblock.md) |  | Set the offset of this connection relative to the top left of its block. |
|  [startTrackingAll()](./blockly.renderedconnection.starttrackingall.md) |  | Start tracking this connection, as well as all down-stream connections on any block attached to this connection. This happens when a block is expanded. |
|  [targetBlock()](./blockly.renderedconnection.targetblock.md) |  | Returns the block that this connection connects to. |
|  [unhighlight()](./blockly.renderedconnection.unhighlight.md) |  | Remove the highlighting around this connection. |
