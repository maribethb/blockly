## minimalist.RenderInfo class

An object containing all sizing information needed to draw this block.

This measure pass does not propagate changes to the block (although fields may choose to rerender when getSize() is called). However, calling it repeatedly may be expensive.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class RenderInfo extends BaseRenderInfo 
```
<b>Extends:</b> BaseRenderInfo

## Remarks

The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `RenderInfo` class.
