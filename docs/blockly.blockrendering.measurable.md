## blockRendering.Measurable class

The base class to represent a part of a block that takes up space during rendering. The constructor for each non-spacer Measurable records the size of the block element (e.g. field, statement input).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class Measurable 
```

## Remarks

The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `Measurable` class.
