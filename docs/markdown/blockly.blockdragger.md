## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [disconnectBlock\_(healStack, currentDragDeltaXY)](./blockly.blockdragger.disconnectblock_.md) |  | Disconnects the block and moves it to a new location. |
|  [drag(e, currentDragDeltaXY)](./blockly.blockdragger.drag.md) |  | Execute a step of block dragging, based on the given event. Update the display accordingly. |
|  [dragIcons\_(dxy)](./blockly.blockdragger.dragicons_.md) |  | Move all of the icons connected to this drag. |
|  [endDrag(e, currentDragDeltaXY)](./blockly.blockdragger.enddrag.md) |  | Finish a block drag and put the block back on the workspace. |
|  [fireDragEndEvent\_()](./blockly.blockdragger.firedragendevent_.md) |  | Fire a UI event at the end of a block drag. |
|  [fireDragStartEvent\_()](./blockly.blockdragger.firedragstartevent_.md) |  | Fire a UI event at the start of a block drag. |
|  [fireMoveEvent\_()](./blockly.blockdragger.firemoveevent_.md) |  | Fire a move event at the end of a block drag. |
|  [getInsertionMarkers()](./blockly.blockdragger.getinsertionmarkers.md) |  | Get a list of the insertion markers that currently exist. Drags have 0, 1, or 2 insertion markers.  A possibly empty list of insertion marker blocks. |
|  [getNewLocationAfterDrag\_(currentDragDeltaXY)](./blockly.blockdragger.getnewlocationafterdrag_.md) |  | Calculates the drag delta and new location values after a block is dragged. |
|  [maybeDeleteBlock\_()](./blockly.blockdragger.maybedeleteblock_.md) |  | May delete the dragging block, if allowed. If <code>this.wouldDeleteBlock_</code> is not true, the block will not be deleted. This should be called at the end of a block drag.  True if the block was deleted. |
|  [pixelsToWorkspaceUnits\_(pixelCoord)](./blockly.blockdragger.pixelstoworkspaceunits_.md) |  | Convert a coordinate object from pixels to workspace units, including a correction for mutator workspaces. This function does not consider differing origins. It simply scales the input's x and y values. |
|  [shouldDisconnect\_(healStack)](./blockly.blockdragger.shoulddisconnect_.md) |  | Whether or not we should disconnect the block when a drag is started. |
|  [startDrag(currentDragDeltaXY, healStack)](./blockly.blockdragger.startdrag.md) |  | Start dragging a block. This includes moving it to the drag surface. |
|  [updateBlockAfterMove\_(delta)](./blockly.blockdragger.updateblockaftermove_.md) |  | Updates the necessary information to place a block at a certain location. |
|  [updateCursorDuringBlockDrag\_()](./blockly.blockdragger.updatecursorduringblockdrag_.md) |  | Update the cursor (and possibly the trash can lid) to reflect whether the dragging block would be deleted if released immediately. |
|  [updateToolboxStyle\_(isEnd)](./blockly.blockdragger.updatetoolboxstyle_.md) |  | Adds or removes the style of the cursor for the toolbox. This is what changes the cursor to display an x when a deletable block is held over the toolbox. |
