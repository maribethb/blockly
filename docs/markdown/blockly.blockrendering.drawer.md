|  [drawLeft\_()](./blockly.blockrendering.drawer.drawleft_.md) |  | Add steps for the left side of the block, which may include an output connection |
|  [drawOutline\_()](./blockly.blockrendering.drawer.drawoutline_.md) |  | Create the outline of the block. This is a single continuous path. |
|  [drawRightSideRow\_(row)](./blockly.blockrendering.drawer.drawrightsiderow_.md) |  | Add steps for the right side of a row that does not have value or statement input connections. |
|  [drawStatementInput\_(row)](./blockly.blockrendering.drawer.drawstatementinput_.md) |  | Add steps for a statement input. |
|  [drawTop\_()](./blockly.blockrendering.drawer.drawtop_.md) |  | Add steps for the top corner of the block, taking into account details such as hats and rounded corners. |

|  [positionExternalValueConnection\_(row)](./blockly.blockrendering.drawer.positionexternalvalueconnection_.md) |  | Position the connection on an external value input, taking into account RTL and the small gap between the parent block and child block which lets the parent block's dark path show through. |
|  [positionInlineInputConnection\_(input)](./blockly.blockrendering.drawer.positioninlineinputconnection_.md) |  | Position the connection on an inline value input, taking into account RTL and the small gap between the parent block and child block which lets the parent block's dark path show through. |
|  [positionNextConnection\_()](./blockly.blockrendering.drawer.positionnextconnection_.md) |  | Position the next connection on a block. |
|  [positionOutputConnection\_()](./blockly.blockrendering.drawer.positionoutputconnection_.md) |  | Position the output connection on a block. |
|  [positionPreviousConnection\_()](./blockly.blockrendering.drawer.positionpreviousconnection_.md) |  | Position the previous connection on a block. |
|  [positionStatementInputConnection\_(row)](./blockly.blockrendering.drawer.positionstatementinputconnection_.md) |  | Position the connection on a statement input, taking into account RTL and the small gap between the parent block and child block which lets the parent block's dark path show through. |
|  [recordSizeOnBlock\_()](./blockly.blockrendering.drawer.recordsizeonblock_.md) |  | Save sizing information back to the block Most of the rendering information can be thrown away at the end of the render. Anything that needs to be kept around should be set in this function. |
