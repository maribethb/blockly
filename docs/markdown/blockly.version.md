## VERSION variable

Blockly core version. This constant is overridden by the build script (npm run build) to the value of the version in package.json. This is done by the Closure Compiler in the buildCompressed gulp task. For local builds, you can pass --define='Blockly.VERSION=X.Y.Z' to the compiler to override this constant.  {<!-- -->string<!-- -->}  Blockly.VERSION

<b>Signature:</b>

```
