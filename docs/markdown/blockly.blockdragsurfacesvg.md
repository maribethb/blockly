## Constructors

|  Constructor | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [(constructor)(container)](./blockly.blockdragsurfacesvg._constructor_.md) |  | Constructs a new instance of the <code>BlockDragSurfaceSvg</code> class |

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [clearAndHide(opt\_newSurface)](./blockly.blockdragsurfacesvg.clearandhide.md) |  | Clear the group and hide the surface; move the blocks off onto the provided element. If the block is being deleted it doesn't need to go back to the original surface, since it would be removed immediately during dispose. |
|  [createDom()](./blockly.blockdragsurfacesvg.createdom.md) |  | Create the drag surface and inject it into the container. |
|  [getCurrentBlock()](./blockly.blockdragsurfacesvg.getcurrentblock.md) |  | Get the current blocks on the drag surface, if any (primarily for BlockSvg.getRelativeToSurfaceXY).  Drag surface block DOM element, or null if no blocks exist. |
|  [getGroup()](./blockly.blockdragsurfacesvg.getgroup.md) |  | Provide a reference to the drag group (primarily for BlockSvg.getRelativeToSurfaceXY).  Drag surface group element. |
|  [getSurfaceTranslation()](./blockly.blockdragsurfacesvg.getsurfacetranslation.md) |  | Reports the surface translation in scaled workspace coordinates. Use this when finishing a drag to return blocks to the correct position.  Current translation of the surface. |
|  [getSvgRoot()](./blockly.blockdragsurfacesvg.getsvgroot.md) |  | Returns the SVG drag surface. |
|  [getWsTranslation()](./blockly.blockdragsurfacesvg.getwstranslation.md) |  | Gets the translation of the child block surface This surface is in charge of keeping track of how much the workspace has moved.  The amount the workspace has been moved. |
|  [setBlocksAndShow(blocks)](./blockly.blockdragsurfacesvg.setblocksandshow.md) |  | Set the SVG blocks on the drag surface's group and show the surface. Only one block group should be on the drag surface at a time. |
|  [translateAndScaleGroup(x, y, scale)](./blockly.blockdragsurfacesvg.translateandscalegroup.md) |  | Translate and scale the entire drag surface group to the given position, to keep in sync with the workspace. |
|  [translateBy(deltaX, deltaY)](./blockly.blockdragsurfacesvg.translateby.md) |  | Translates the entire surface by a relative offset. |
|  [translateSurface(x, y)](./blockly.blockdragsurfacesvg.translatesurface.md) |  | Translate the entire drag surface during a drag. We translate the drag surface instead of the blocks inside the surface so that the browser avoids repainting the SVG. Because of this, the drag coordinates must be adjusted by scale. |
|  [translateSurfaceInternal\_()](./blockly.blockdragsurfacesvg.translatesurfaceinternal_.md) |  | Translate the drag surface's SVG based on its internal state.  |
