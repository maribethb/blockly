|  Class | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [BottomRow](./blockly.zelos.bottomrow.md) | An object containing information about what elements are in the bottom row of a block as well as spacing information for the top row. Elements in a bottom row can consist of corners, spacers and next connections.  Blockly.zelos.BottomRow |
|  [ConstantProvider](./blockly.zelos.constantprovider.md) | An object that provides constants for rendering blocks in Zelos mode.  Blockly.zelos.ConstantProvider |
|  [Drawer](./blockly.zelos.drawer.md) | An object that draws a block based on the given rendering information.  Blockly.zelos.Drawer |
|  [MarkerSvg](./blockly.zelos.markersvg.md) | Class to draw a marker.  Blockly.zelos.MarkerSvg |

|  [RenderInfo](./blockly.zelos.renderinfo.md) | An object containing all sizing information needed to draw this block.<!-- -->This measure pass does not propagate changes to the block (although fields may choose to rerender when getSize() is called). However, calling it repeatedly may be expensive.  Blockly.zelos.RenderInfo |
|  [RightConnectionShape](./blockly.zelos.rightconnectionshape.md) | An object containing information about the space a right connection shape takes up during rendering.  Blockly.zelos.RightConnectionShape |
|  [StatementInput](./blockly.zelos.statementinput.md) | An object containing information about the space a statement input takes up during rendering.  Blockly.zelos.StatementInput |
|  [TopRow](./blockly.zelos.toprow.md) | An object containing information about what elements are in the top row of a block as well as sizing information for the top row. Elements in a top row can consist of corners, hats, spacers, and previous connections. After this constructor is called, the row will contain all non-spacer elements it needs.
