## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [getNextNode\_(node, isValid)](./blockly.basiccursor.getnextnode_.md) |  | Uses pre order traversal to navigate the Blockly AST. This will allow a user to easily navigate the entire Blockly AST without having to go in and out levels on the tree. |
|  [getPreviousNode\_(node, isValid)](./blockly.basiccursor.getpreviousnode_.md) |  | Reverses the pre order traversal in order to find the previous node. This will allow a user to easily navigate the entire Blockly AST without having to go in and out levels on the tree. |
|  [in()](./blockly.basiccursor.in.md) |  | For a basic cursor we only have the ability to go next and previous, so in will also allow the user to get to the next node in the pre order traversal.  The next node, or null if the current node is not set or there is no next value. |
|  [next()](./blockly.basiccursor.next.md) |  | Find the next node in the pre order traversal.  The next node, or null if the current node is not set or there is no next value. |
|  [out()](./blockly.basiccursor.out.md) |  | For a basic cursor we only have the ability to go next and previous, so out will allow the user to get to the previous node in the pre order traversal.  The previous node, or null if the current node is not set or there is no previous value. |
|  [prev()](./blockly.basiccursor.prev.md) |  | Find the previous node in the pre order traversal.  The previous node, or null if the current node is not set or there is no previous value. |
|  [validNode\_(node)](./blockly.basiccursor.validnode_.md) |  | Decides what nodes to traverse and which ones to skip. Currently, it skips output, stack and workspace nodes. |
